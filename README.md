# XLang Playground Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the XLang Playground Repository! This repository is dedicated to providing practical examples and learning resources for XLang, a versatile and powerful programming language. Our goal is to help developers explore the capabilities of XLang in various scenarios and applications.

## Example101 Project

### Description

The Example101 project is a showcase of a simple Win32 application, demonstrating the core features of XLang integration. It includes:

- A basic window creation and event handling in a Win32 application.
